# Student Performance Analysis Excel Project

**Description**


This project is an Excel-based tool designed to analyze and visualize student performance data. 
The dataset includes information on student names, marks in each subject, weekly study time, weekly absences, and strengths and weaknesses for each subject. 
The data is visualized through interactive graphs and charts, allowing easy filtering of student-specific information.

**This Excel file allows users to:**

View individual student performance (marks, study time, absences, strengths, and weaknesses).
Filter by student name to display personalized data.
Visualize data through dynamic graphs for easier analysis and comparison.

**Features**

Interactive Filtering: Filter by student name to view individual performance data.
Visual Data Representation: Graphs and charts that represent student marks, study time, and absences.
Detailed Analysis: Breakdown of strengths and weaknesses for each subject, aiding in personalized learning improvements.
User-Friendly Interface: Easily navigate through different students' data by using the built-in Excel filtering functionality.

Installation

Download the Excel File: Clone or download the repository to your local system:
https://github.com/karrea09/my_projects
Open the File: Open the Excel file in Microsoft Excel (or a compatible spreadsheet program like Google Sheets, though some features like filtering might not work as expected).
Enable Macros (If Applicable): If you’ve used VBA macros for any advanced functionality, ensure macros are enabled:
Go to the Developer tab.
Select Macros to run any specific automated tasks, if available.

**Usage**

Open the Excel File:
After opening the file, you will see a dataset with student names, marks, study time, absences, and other relevant data.
Filter by Student:
Use the filter at the top of the "Visualization" sheet to select a specific student.
When you select a student’s name, the data for that student (marks in each subject, study time, absences, strengths, and weaknesses) will be displayed.
View Graphs and Charts:
The graphs and charts in the file will update automatically based on the selected student, providing a visual representation of their performance, study habits, and attendance.
Analyze Data:
Review the strengths and weaknesses section for each subject to identify areas for improvement.
Use the graphs for a quick overview of the student’s performance trends.

Example

Let’s say you want to check the performance of Student X:

Go to the "Visualization" sheet.
Use the filter to select Student X.
The corresponding marks, average study time, average absences, and strengths/weaknesses will be displayed.
The graphs will automatically update to reflect the data for Student X.
